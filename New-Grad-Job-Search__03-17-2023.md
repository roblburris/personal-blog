# My Experience Job Hunting as a New Grad in 2023
My four years of undergrad have been interesting - I got half a year in person, followed by a year and a half online, a weird hybrid junior year, and a ‘normal’ senior year so adding graduating into an economic downturn into the mix is probably just a small detail to this story. Nonetheless as someone deadset on going into industry after graduating, I knew I was going to be recruiting in a tight market.

## Timeline
Here’s a rough timeline of my 2023 New Grad recruiting process:
* July 2022: started applying
* August 2022: First Offer!
* August 2022 - November 2022: Interviews
* November 2022: Offer signed with Palantir!
One thing to note is that I started applying early. From what I remember, I read two important in July:
* Meta was delaying giving return offer decisions to Summer 2022 interns
* Google was going on a 2 week hiring freeze
To me, this was worrisome news so I started applying pretty quick. I figured best case I spend some time applying and interviewing only to get a return offer from Google like a normal year, worst case I get some offers and can compare to my return offer at Intuit. I leveraged the coderQuad 2023 New Grad Positions Github repo to find applications and began slowly applying to various companies. From there, I began getting Online Assessments (OAs) and started interviewing at the start of August.

## Interviews
### August 2022
For OAs, it seemed like a lot of them were automated so I won’t spend much time on these. Here are the notable ones that lead to interviews:
* Capital One: OA -> Final Round
* Amazon: OA -> Final Round
I also got a two phone interviews post resume screen from Applied Intuition and Jane Street. 

#### Capital One
Capital One was my first interview of the recruiting season. I scheduled this one for the beginning of August and had three separate hourlong interviews: one leetcode, one behavioral, and one case interview. I enjoyed speaking with my interviewers about their experience at Capital One and ended up receiving an offer a few days after my final round. Unfortunately, the compensation was on the lower end relative to my other offers so I ended up declining their offer.

#### Applied Intuition
For Applied Intuition I had two interviews: a behavioral screen with a recruiter followed by an hour long phone interview. The behavioral screen was pretty standard and in the phone interview I got asked a medium leetcode problem that involved some math/physics. Admittedly the math required caught me by a bit of a surprise so it took me a bit longer to get the solution which I think was my reason for not passing.

#### Jane Street
For Jane Street I also had two interviews: an hourlong phone interview and a final round consisting of three separate hourlong interviews and a chance for me to speak to two Jane Street engineers. I really liked interviewing with Jane Street - all the engineers I spoke to were extremely talented and it was very enlightening getting to hear about what they were working on. One common sentiment you find online is that Jane Street has a tough but very good interview and I wholeheartedly agree. The questions I got asked were pretty difficult but very fair (i.e. I didn’t need to know an obscure algorithm to solve the problem) and by the end of my final round, I was pretty exhausted. I was rejected after the final round but I was fine with the result as I really liked my work at Google and want to stay in tech. However, if my plans change in the future I’ll definitely be applying to Jane Street again.

#### Amazon
Like Capital One, my Amazon process was just an OA followed by a final round. My final round was just one 30 minute interview with an Amazon engineer where we briefly discussed my OA and I got a chance to ask him questions about his work at Amazon. Pretty straightforward process and I received an offer a few days later.

### September - November 2022
With UW being on the quarter system and starting our Fall quarter at the end of September, I stopped interviewing as much since my internship was coming to an end and I was about to move back home and start school. I focused less on school in the fall and mainly interviewed.

#### Hive
A recruiter on LinkedIn reached out to me about Hive, a Series D ML startup working on creating general ML models for enterprise companies. This seemed pretty cool to me so I interviewed with Hive over the course of September and October. I had 3 technical rounds (2 with engineers, 1 with CTO) and had an offer call with the CEO. The compensation was amazing but with a majority of the compensation being in pre-IPO RSUs and the current economic climate, I decided to decline the offer.

#### Arista Networks
In October, the CSE department at UW had a career fair and I spoke to a multitude of companies. One of them was Arista Networks where I got to speak to an engineer and thought the work they were doing was pretty cool. I managed to get an interview from this and had a phone interview followed by a final interview, both of which were one hour technical interviews. The final round was pretty unique in that it was conducted over ssh and I really enjoyed speaking with my interviewers about their work at Arista. I was able to get my offer negotiated up and was very close to signing but ended up receiving an offer from my next company which I liked more. 

#### Palantir
Like Arista, Palantir was also at UW’s career fair and I spoke to a few engineers about FDSE and Palantir Apollo. Funnily enough, I applied to Palantir in July and got rejected but they had a link where I submitted my email and I got an invite to a technical interview conducted with Karat. The Karat interview was pretty standard (three leetcode questions in an hour) and after passing, I was invited to a 30 minute phone interview. This was completely behavioral and afterwards I got interviewed to the notorious Palantir onsite consisting of a ‘decomposition’ and ‘learning’ interview. From reading online, people described the decomposition interview as a system design interview which I wasn’t too enthused about given my lack of experience giving system design interviews. However, it wasn’t really a system design interview (at least in the traditional sense you’d expect a L5+ to be interviewed at) and knowledge from distributed systems, databases, and projects turned out to be enough.  I really liked the questions asked in my onsite and was excited to find out I passed and had a final round with a hiring manger.

Around this time, I was scheduling around an offer deadline with Hive and originally had my Palantir final round scheduled for a Monday before getting it moved to a Thursday. On Monday, I ended up getting an email at 6am saying they wanted to keep my final round which I didn’t see until I woke up which was about 5 minutes before the interview time. Not wanting to deal with rescheduling (this was also nearing Thanksgiving so I didn’t want to wait until after Thanksgiving to interview), I jumped out of bed and ran to get ready. My final round was a repeat of my decomposition interview and also had quite a few behavioral questions. Despite my rushed appearance, I was super excited to find out I got an offer a few days later! 


## Offer Evaluations
I received offers from Intuit (return), Capital One, Amazon, Hive, Arista, and Palantir. This past year was my first opportunity to work as a Software Engineer having done back to back internships at Intuit and Google and these were super valuable experiences. I figured out want I want to work on 

Going into recruiting, my main priorities were compensation similar to what I could expect from a Google return offer, a safe offer hopefully not subject to rescinds in economic downturn, and work that was exciting to me. For compensation, this ruled out Intuit and Capital One. Hive felt a bit risky given the economic climate and them being pre-IPO so it was down to Amazon, Arista, and Palantir. Palantir beat Amazon and Arista in compensation and the work also seemed more exciting. Another thing that influenced my decision was my experience talking to Palantir engineers. From the career fair to my final round, every engineer had a genuine interest in their work and all had tenure greater than 4 years. After having a very positive experience at Google where I really enjoyed going to work and working on my project, I wanted to try and find work that would be interesting to me. Amazon had quite interesting work but Palantir’s product centered business focused around big data analytics seemed more interesting to me at the moment. Lastly, a nice plus to Palantir was the offer location - NYC.

### Conclusions
I didn’t do much Leetcode (6 questions solved from July 2022 - September) during this recruiting cycle. Doing some more interview prep probably would have been helpful in allowing me to solve problems faster but it may have only been a marginal improvement. Regardless, I’m super happy to have an offer in this economic climate and am super excited to be joining Palantir. If you told me 2 years ago I’d be heading to Palantir as a new grad, I’d probably say you were lying so here’s to a new chapter after graduating at Palantir in NYC!
